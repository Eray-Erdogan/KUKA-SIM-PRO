<ul>
<li>Industrial Robot Programming</li>
<li>Three-dimensional <em>(<em>3d</em>)</em> robot programming prepared with KUKA Sim Pro 3.1.2</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>•Kuka robots are widely used in every sector nowadays.  It is seen that it also intersects with the entertainment field.</p>
<p>•Throwing a frisbee back and forth which is highly dependent on the forward kinematic action.</p>
<p>•Moving back to the home position is a movement which is linked to the inverse kinematics.</p>
<p>•In order to speed up the throwing process, we made the robot to do a circular motion which creates a momentum and increases the velocity of the throw.</p>
<h2 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h2>
<p>•The main goal of this project is to manipulate Kuka robots into playing a frisbee.</p>
<p>•We are going to manipulate the frisbee into two different motions, which are circular motion and linear motion.</p>
<p>•Throwing an object with a Kuka robot is simple, however making it catch a flying object is not.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>•Articulated robot (RRR) gives us is that it gives us the opportunity to reach and control the desired direction and the desired angle more than the others.</p>
<p>•Linear units are used in order to conduct the frisbee throw.</p>
<p>•The end-effector position and orientation was manipulated in order to create a circular motion for the frisbee throw</p>
<p>•Vacuum Cups &amp; Magnets - These are the components that actually contact the part or finished product that needs to be held or moved.</p>
<p>• Combine the linear motion and Linear Equations and Energy correlations. With the relationship of the linear and angular speed/acceleration</p>
